Each usage is absolutely at your own risk.\r\nI strongly advice, not to use these scripts or snippets without prior backup of the complete system (sourcecode, database).\r\n\r\nIt will be extended as often as possible. If you have tools (Scripts, Snippets) you want to add, just contact me.\r\n\r\n# directory structure\r\n\r\nFirst of all the SQL-snippets has been seperated into their \"section\" of usage.
