# openmagetools
my Open-Source Mage-Tools (e.g. SQL-Snippets)

This toolbox is made to support all Mage-Developers in their daily business, e.g. there are some SQL-Snippets
to use with demo-data.

It will be extended as often as possible. If you have tools (Scripts, Snippets) you want to add, just contact me.
